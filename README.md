Within the context of a Software Engineering class, follows this semester's assignment:

The TEDK Project Kit aims to provide a hands-on, practical learning experience for all those willing to learn. 
With a focus on tech builds, this kit enables users to create 25 distinct projects, including a build-it yourself calculator, through structured instructions, hardware components, and software support. 
The primary goal is to equip users with a deeper understanding of programming, electronics, and problem-solving by building real-world applications from scratch.
The kit includes hardware components, pre-programmed guiding sketches, and a digital interface (web app) that provides project guides, instructions, and troubleshooting. 
This SRD focuses primarily on the software requirements for managing project instructions and guiding users through building a basic calculator.


On this repository will rest the codes and files relevant to the project.
