            <h3>My Arduino is not recognizing the components. What should I check?</h3>
            <p>Ensure that all components are properly wired and securely connected to the Arduino board. Double-check that you are using the correct pin numbers in the code. If the issue continues, verify that the Arduino board drivers are installed correctly and that the Arduino IDE is configured to the right board type and port.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>The code is not uploading to the Arduino. What can I do?</h3>
            <p>Check that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE. If you're using a different USB cable or port, try switching to another one. Ensure that no other software is blocking the connection, and check that your Arduino IDE is updated to the latest version. If you continue to face issues, try restarting the IDE or the computer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>What should I do if my device isn't responding to inputs?</h3>
            <p>Check the wiring for each input component (such as buttons or sensors). Ensure that the correct pins are being used in the code and that all connections are secure. If the issue continues, verify the components' functionality by testing them separately with simple code to rule out hardware failure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>My Arduino project isn't powering on. What should I check?</h3>
            <p>Ensure that the Arduino is properly connected to the power source, and that the power cable is securely inserted. If you're using a USB cable, check the connection to your computer. For battery-powered projects, verify that the battery is correctly inserted and charged. If the device still doesn't turn on, check the power switch and inspect the board for any visible damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>The LED is not blinking in my LED Blinker project. What could be wrong?</h3>
            <p>Check that the LED is correctly inserted, with the positive leg (longer leg) connected to the Arduino pin and the negative leg to ground. Ensure that the current-limiting resistor (usually 220 ohms) is in place to avoid damaging the LED. Double-check your code to make sure it's properly uploading to the Arduino. If the issue persists, try testing with a different LED or Arduino pin.</p>

        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>My temperature sensor isn't showing correct readings. What should I do?</h3>
            <p>Ensure that the DHT11 sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino (the data pin should be connected to the right pin on the Arduino). Check the wiring for any loose connections. Make sure the sensor is not exposed to extreme temperatures or moisture, which might affect its readings. Also, verify that the sensor's library is correctly installed in your Arduino IDE. If the issue persists, try using a different sensor or test with a different Arduino pin.</p>

        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>My robot isn't avoiding obstacles. What could be wrong?</h3>
            <p>Check the ultrasonic sensor's wiring and ensure it's properly connected to the Arduino. Make sure the sensor is facing forward and has a clear line of sight to detect obstacles. Test the sensor with a simple script to ensure it's working before integrating it with your robot. If the robot isn't responding to obstacles, verify that the motor driver is wired correctly and that the motors are powered.</p>

        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>My Arduino isn't connecting to the computer. What should I do?</h3>
            <p>Ensure that the USB cable is functioning correctly and is securely connected to both the Arduino and your computer. Try using a different USB port on your computer or another cable. Check that the correct Arduino board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE. If the issue persists, restart the IDE and try uploading a simple sketch (like the Blink example) to check if the issue is specific to your project.</p>

        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>Some components are missing from my kit. What should I do?</h3>
            <p>Double-check the packaging and the parts list to confirm that all components should be included. Make sure that any hidden or smaller components arenâ€™t overlooked inside packaging material. If a component is still missing, contact customer support to request a replacement or resolve the issue. You can also check if any components have been replaced with alternatives in the kit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
            <h3>What should I do if I encounter an issue with my project?</h3>
            <p>If you're having trouble with any of the projects, first ensure all components are correctly connected according to the instructions. If the issue persists, check the code for any errors or mismatches with the components you're using.
